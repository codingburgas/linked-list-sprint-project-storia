After 983, the Bulgarian Empire was led by Samuil, one of the four Cometopuli brothers who had risen against Byzantine rule following the empire's internal struggles. By this time, Bulgaria had already lost its eastern territories, including its capital Preslav, to Byzantium. Despite these losses, Samuil managed to establish a strong power base in the western regions, including Macedonia, Albania, and parts of Serbia and Greece.

In 986, Byzantine Emperor Basil II launched a large-scale campaign to crush Bulgaria and marched towards Sofia, an important strategic city. However, on his return, he was ambushed and decisively defeated at the Battle of Trajan’s Gate, suffering one of the greatest defeats of his reign. This victory solidified Bulgarian control over the Balkans and delayed Byzantine attempts to reconquer the empire. Over the next decade, Samuil strengthened Bulgaria’s military and political power, launching raids deep into Byzantine territory.

By 997, after the death of Roman, the last ruler from the Krum dynasty, Samuil declared himself Tsar of Bulgaria, making his rule official. His campaigns extended Bulgarian influence across the western Balkans, and he even attempted to form alliances with neighboring rulers to resist Byzantine expansion. However, Basil II gradually rebuilt his military strength, determined to reclaim lost Byzantine lands. The conflict between the two rulers turned into a prolonged war, with battles being fought across the Balkans.

At the beginning of the 11th century, Byzantium started gaining the upper hand. Basil II's strategy involved attacking Bulgarian fortresses, cutting off supply routes, and weakening Bulgaria through relentless military pressure. One of the most significant Byzantine victories came in 1014 at the Battle of Kleidion, where the Bulgarian army was trapped and suffered a devastating defeat. Basil II reportedly ordered the blinding of 15,000 Bulgarian soldiers, leaving one man with a single eye for every hundred to guide the rest back to Samuil. When Samuil saw the horrific sight of his mutilated army, he suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterward.

Following Samuil’s death, Bulgaria's resistance weakened. His successor, Gavril Radomir, attempted to fight back but was assassinated in 1015 by his cousin Ivan Vladislav, who seized power. Ivan Vladislav made one last attempt to preserve Bulgarian independence, launching diplomatic and military efforts to push back Byzantine advances. However, in 1018, after his death in battle, the remaining Bulgarian nobles surrendered to Basil II, bringing the First Bulgarian Empire to an end.

Bulgaria was fully incorporated into the Byzantine Empire, and Basil II took measures to integrate the Bulgarian aristocracy into Byzantine administration. He granted privileges to Bulgarian nobles and allowed the Bulgarian Church to retain some autonomy under the Archbishopric of Ohrid. However, Bulgarian independence was lost, and the country remained under Byzantine rule for nearly 170 years, until the uprising of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185.
