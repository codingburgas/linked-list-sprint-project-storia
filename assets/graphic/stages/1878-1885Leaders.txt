Prince Alexander I | of Battenberg: Alexander I of Battenberg (1857-1893) was the first Prince of Bulgaria, ruling from 1879 to 1886. He was elected by the Grand National Assembly in 1879 following Bulgariaâ€™s liberation from Ottoman rule. His reign was marked by political struggles, including conflicts between pro-Russian and pro-liberal factions.

In 1881, he suspended the Tarnovo Constitution and established a period of personal rule with Russian support. However, due to growing opposition and pressure, he restored the constitution in 1883. He played a crucial role in the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia on September 6, 1885, an act that significantly strengthened Bulgarian national unity.
