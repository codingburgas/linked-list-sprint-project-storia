Formation of the Bulgarian State (681)
The Bulgarian state was officially established in 681 when Khan Asparuh led the Bulgars across the Danube and settled in the Balkans. After defeating the Byzantine forces of Emperor Constantine IV in the Battle of Ongal, the Byzantines were forced to recognize the new state through a peace treaty. This treaty granted the Bulgars control over the lands between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains, with Pliska as their capital. Asparuh focused on fortifying his new state, developing its military capabilities, and fostering relations with the Slavic tribes inhabiting the region.

Khan Tervel (700-721)
Khan Tervel, Asparuh's successor, strengthened Bulgaria’s position in the region. He played a key role in Byzantine politics, assisting Emperor Justinian II in regaining his throne in 705. In return, Tervel received the Zagore region in present-day Bulgaria. In 717-718, he helped defend Constantinople from the Arab siege, contributing to the ultimate defeat of the invading Umayyad forces. This solidified Bulgaria’s reputation as a major power. His rule also saw economic growth and the strengthening of fortifications, ensuring the state’s stability.

Khan Sevar and Political Turmoil (738-753)
Following Tervel's reign, Bulgaria went through a period of internal instability. Several short-lived rulers came and went, with Khan Sevar (738-753) being the last of Asparuh’s direct lineage. The throne frequently changed hands due to internal power struggles and external threats, particularly from the Byzantines.

Khan Kormisosh and Khan Vinekh (753-761)
Khan Kormisosh, from a different ruling family, ascended to power and attempted to strengthen Bulgaria’s position against Byzantine aggression. However, he faced military defeats, leading to his overthrow. His successor, Khan Vinekh, pursued diplomacy but was eventually removed due to dissatisfaction with his policies.

Khan Telets (761-765) and Khan Telerig (768-777)
Khan Telets took a more aggressive stance against Byzantium, but his confrontational policies led to internal opposition and his eventual downfall. Khan Telerig later consolidated power and outmaneuvered Byzantine spies, ensuring more stability in the state.

Khan Kardam (777-803)
Khan Kardam managed to restore internal stability and successfully engaged the Byzantine Empire in several conflicts. His rule laid the foundation for the rise of Khan Krum, one of Bulgaria’s most significant rulers.

Khan Krum (803-814)
One of the most notable Bulgarian rulers of this period was Khan Krum, who greatly expanded Bulgarian territory and strengthened its governance. He defeated the Avars, incorporating their lands into Bulgaria, and then turned his attention to the Byzantines. In 811, he won a decisive victory against Emperor Nikephoros I at the Battle of Pliska, in which the Byzantine army was annihilated and the emperor was killed—one of the greatest defeats in Byzantine history.

Krum implemented significant internal reforms, improving laws and administration, aiming to unify the diverse populations of his empire. He introduced strict laws against crime and corruption, strengthened central authority, and encouraged agricultural and economic growth. His efforts laid the foundation for the further expansion of Bulgaria.

Conclusion
The period from 681 to 814 saw the transformation of Bulgaria from a new political entity into a formidable empire. The military successes, strategic alliances, and internal reforms of rulers such as Asparuh, Tervel, and Krum ensured the survival and prosperity of the First Bulgarian Empire, setting the stage for continued influence in the region. The internal governance reforms and territorial expansions during this time established Bulgaria as a key power in the medieval Balkans.
