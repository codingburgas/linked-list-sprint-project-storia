Tsar Boril (r. 1207–1218): Became Tsar of Bulgaria after the assassination of Kaloyan. His reign was marked by internal strife as he struggled to maintain control over the nobility. He faced external threats, including conflicts with Hungary and Serbia, and ultimately lost the throne to his cousin Ivan Asen II.

Ivan Asen II (1218–1241): One of Bulgaria’s most successful rulers, he overthrew Boril and expanded the empire to its greatest territorial extent. His rule was characterized by economic prosperity, diplomatic successes, and religious tolerance. Under his leadership, Bulgaria became a major power in the Balkans.

Ivaylo (1277–1279): A peasant leader who led a rebellion against the nobility and Mongol incursions. His victories over the Mongols and the Bulgarian aristocracy earned him the throne, but he faced strong opposition from the nobles and foreign forces. He was eventually overthrown and killed while seeking asylum in the Mongol court.

Various Rulers (1241–1277, 1279–1396): After Ivan Asen II's death, Bulgaria entered a period of instability. Successive rulers, including Constantine Tikh and Michael Shishman, struggled with internal divisions and external threats from the Mongols, Byzantines, and Serbs. This decline culminated in Bulgaria's fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1396.

Paisius of Hilendar (1722–1773): A Bulgarian monk and historian, he wrote Slav-Bulgarian History in 1762, a crucial work that inspired the Bulgarian National Revival. His efforts helped preserve Bulgarian identity during Ottoman rule and encouraged resistance against cultural assimilation.

Various Revolutionaries (19th century): The Bulgarian National Revival saw the rise of key figures like Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, and Georgi Rakovski, who fought for independence through education, literature, and armed resistance. Their efforts culminated in the April Uprising of 1876, which, though suppressed, led to European intervention.

Revolutionary Leaders (April Uprising, 1876): Leaders such as Todor Kableshkov, Stefan Stambolov, and Panayot Volov played key roles in organizing the rebellion against the Ottomans. Though it failed, their actions set the stage for Bulgaria’s liberation.

Russian and Ottoman Forces (Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878): The war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire resulted in Bulgaria's liberation. Russian military leaders like General Gurko and Bulgarian volunteers (Opalchenets) played a crucial role in achieving independence.
