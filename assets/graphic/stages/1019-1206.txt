After the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018, the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Basil II, took control of Bulgarian territories. Basil II implemented a relatively lenient rule, allowing local Bulgarian nobility to retain certain privileges. The region was reorganized into the Byzantine theme of Bulgaria, with its center in Skopje and later Ohrid. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church was preserved but downgraded to an archbishopric under the jurisdiction of Constantinople.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, there were multiple attempts by the Bulgarians to restore their independence. One of the most significant revolts occurred in 1040-1041, led by Peter Delyan, who declared himself Emperor of Bulgaria. His rebellion was initially successful but was ultimately suppressed by the Byzantines. Another major uprising took place in 1072 under Georgi Voiteh, who sought to restore the Bulgarian state with the support of Serbian and Norman allies, but it was also crushed.

In the late 12th century, Byzantine control weakened due to internal struggles and external invasions. This instability allowed the Bulgarians to successfully revolt in 1185, led by the noble brothers Asen and Peter. They proclaimed the restoration of the Bulgarian state, establishing the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital in Tarnovo. By 1187, the Byzantines recognized Bulgarian independence de facto, though conflicts continued between the two states.

Tsar Kaloyan (1197-1207) expanded the newly reestablished Bulgarian state, defeating Byzantine forces and negotiating with the Pope to secure international recognition. In 1204, following the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, Kaloyan initially allied with the crusaders but later turned against them, defeating the Latin Empire at the Battle of Adrianople in 1205. His reign strengthened Bulgariaâ€™s position in the Balkans before his death in 1207.

The period from 1019 to 1206 was marked by efforts to resist Byzantine rule and ultimately resulted in the reestablishment of an independent Bulgarian state, which would grow into a major power in the region under the Second Bulgarian Empire.
